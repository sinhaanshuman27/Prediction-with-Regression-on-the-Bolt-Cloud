Machine learning (ML) is the branch of computer science in which computers discover patterns and predict trends in data on their own without being explicitly programmed.ML is a powerful tool for creating personalized and dynamic experiences. Although it is already driving everything from Netflix recommendations to autonomous cars, its use with IoT related products is still pretty limited. Moreover, a plethora of tools, use cases, blogs and courses are centered around using ML to work with images, sounds, and big data.These can easily make an IoT developer feel that their low data-rate IoT devices cannot be used with ML. :(To help developers with their quest to use ML with IoT devices, Bolt IoT has recently launched a new feature on their Cloud. This feature allows you to predict the trend in data using Polynomial Regression.
