Step 1: If you have not already done so, sign up to the Bolt Cloud

Step 2: Link your Bolt Device to the Bolt Cloud using the Bolt App (for IOS and Android). The app is very intuitive, so I will not be including the sub steps here.

Step 3: Create a product on the Bolt Cloud of type GPIO Input.

Step 4: Configure the hardware to monitor the A0 pin, and give some variable name for it (Such as light_data)

Step 5: In the code configuration, write the data visualisation code attached with this project. Remember to rename the Y axis (In my case it is light_data).

Step 6: Save and Exit the product configuration.

Step 7: Link the Bolt Module to the newly created product.
